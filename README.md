# Dream

An experimental programming language for WebAssembly. The language is mostly intended
to be a pet project for the years to come. Something to help me understand how computers
work on a lower level.

Goals (In order of importance):
- Developer satisfaction
- Elegant readable syntax
- Predictable syntax and APIs
- Fast
- Easy interop with TypeScript, JavaScript, and hopefully other webassembly languages.
