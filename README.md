# Dream

An experimental programming language for WebAssembly. The language is mostly intended
to be a pet project for the years to come. Something to help me understand how computers
work on a lower level.

Values:
- Simplicity
- Expressiveness
- Easy to for a human to read
- Safety (Memory and Type)
- Performance

## Short Term Goals

- [x] Expressive, easy to read Syntax
- [ ] WebAssembly Target
- [ ] Safe
- [ ] Faster than JS

## Long Term Goals

- [ ] LLVM Target
- [ ] Viable Language for Performant Graphics and Machine Learning
- [ ] Safe Concurrency

## Is it real?

No. At least not yet.
