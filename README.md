# Dream

An experimental programming language for WebAssembly. The language is mostly intended
to be a pet project for the years to come. Something to help me understand how computers
work on a lower level.

Goals (In order of importance):
- Make coders happy - Dream code should be fun to read, write, and maintain.
- Garunteed thread and memory safety
- First class webassembly support
- Predictable - The language should have as few surprises as possible.
- Performant - It should be easy to write highly performant code.
