# Dream

An experimental language targeting WebAssembly.

```rust
fn fib(n: i32) =
    if n < 2 {
        n
    } else {
        fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)
    }

let count = 10

// Supports UFCS
count.fib().print()

// And standard
print(fib(count))
```

Language Goal:
Make writing WASM apps a delight for individuals and teams alike.

Features:
- First class WebAssembly support
- Simple interop with TypeScript / JavaScript
- Expressive syntax
- Support for OOP and Functional paradigms
- Strongly typed, with type inference
- Macros
- Optional GC

Core values:
- Developer satisfaction
- Predictable syntax and APIs
- First class WebAssembly support
- Play nice with others
- Fast performance
- Prefer existing standards when possible
- Quality libraries for web, server, and graphic applications.
