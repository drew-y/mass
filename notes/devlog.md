Effect system implementation ideas:

```ts
type Get = () => number;
type Put = (value: number) => void;

const loop = (n: number) => {
    if (n === 0) return;
    put(get() + 1);
    return loop(n - 1);
};

// Effect functions
const get = (state, continuation) => continuation(state, state.value);
const put = (value, state, continuation) =>
    continuation({ ...state, value }, undefined);

// Transpiled loop function
const loop2 = (
    n: number,
    state: { value: number },
    continuation: (state: { value: number }) => void
) => {
    if (n === 0) return continuation(state, undefined);

    return get(state, (newState, result) =>
        put(result + 1, newState, (newerState) =>
            loop2(n - 1, newerState, continuation)
        )
    );
};

// Example usage
const initialState = { value: 0 };
loop(5, initialState, (finalState, result) => {
    console.log("Final State:", finalState);
    console.log("Result:", result);
});
```

JavaScript / TS Pivot

JavaScript should be a first-class target. WASM is going to take awhile to get where I need it and
this move will make delivering MVP features much easier. It would have the affect of also making the
language a lot more practical / pragmatic.

Ideal features:

- Can natively import js/ts files
- Can emit typescript declaration files
- Supports ES Module Syntax natively?
- Handles function overloads cleanly
- Still easily supports WASM and potentially other sources while still providing a good DX
- A `module.void` format for configuration and exports etc

Open questions:

- Void supports _both_ named parameters _and_ objects and treats each one differently. How should
    this be handled? The best I can think of is that named parameters should be treated as objects
- Need to define a standard for tagged data structures.

## Updated Rules For Parenthetical Elision

1. (Unchanged) Any line with more than one symbol is wrapped with parenthesis (if it does not
     already have them)

     ```void
     add 1 2

     // Becomes
     (add 1 2)
     ```

2. (Updated) Indented lines are wrapped in a block and passed as an argument to the preceding
     function call with one less indentation level, provided:

     1. There are no empty lines between the child and the parent
     2. The first child is not a named argument
     3. The parent is not wrapped in parenthesis

     ```void
     add 2
         mul 4 x

     // Becomes
     (add 2 (block
         (mul 4 x)))
     ```

3. (New) Isolated named arguments, that is named arguments that are on their own line, are applied
     to the preceding function call provided:

     1. There are no empty lines separating between the two
     2. The named argument is on the same indentation level, or 1 child indentation level as the
            preceding function call.

     ```
     try
         this_throws_an_error()
     catch(e):
         print(e)

     // Becomes
     (try
         (block (this_throws_an_error))
         (named catch (lambda (e) (block
             print(e)))))

     // Another example
     if x > y
         then: 3
         else: 5

     // Becomes
     (if (x > y)
         (named then 3)
         (named else 5))
     ```

4. (New) Greedy operators (`=`, `=>`, `|>`, `<|`, `;`) get special handling.

     1. Greedy operators consume indented child blocks, rather than the parent function call

            ```
            let x =
             if (x > y)
                 then: 3
                 else: 5

            // Becomes
            (let (= x
                (block
                    (if (> x y)
                        (named then 3)
                        (named else 5)))))
            ```

     2. If an expression follows a greedy operator on the same line, a new line is inserted after the
            operator and each child line has an additional level of indentation supplied.

            ```
            let z = if x > y
                then: 3
                else: 5

            // Becomes
            let z =
                if x > y
                    then: 3
                    else: 5

            // Which in turn becomes
            (let (=
                z
                (block
                    (if
                        (> z y)
                        (named then 3)
                        (named else 5)))))
            ```

These new rules solve a number of problems in one go.

1. Trailing named arguments no longer need special handling or a different operator
2. Greedy operator rules are simplified
3. Named arguments can now properly accept blocks

Examples of improvements:

```
// Given
accept my: "favorite" stuff:
    do_work()
    again_for_me()

// Translation before new rules
(accept
    (named my "favorite")
    (named stuff (do_work)
    (again_for_me)))

// After new rules
(accept
    (named my "favorite")
    (named stuff
        (block
            (do_work)
            (again_for_me))))
```

## Named Argument Lambda Syntax

```

// Named arguments as lambda functions
fn call(~cb: (v: i32) -> void, val: i32)
    cb(5)

// Usage without accepting the parameter
call cb(): print("hey") 5

// Short for
call
    cb: () =>
        print("hey")
    5

```

Note how `:` is not a consuming operator. There's just no way I can think of to make that work well.
It conflicts to heavily with how we define parameters. (parameters definitions would consume each
other).

# 28 July 2023

Just defined this:

When a named arguments act like a lambda function, and can take parameters:

```
fn call(cb: (v: i32) -> void)
    cb(5)

call cb(v):
    print(v)

// Equivalent to
call cb: (v) =>
    print
```

**Edit 30 July 2023** Ignore the following paragraph

Will require semi-colons to be consuming operators, which would mean that ether those shouldn't work
in parenthesis (which I think maybe should be the case anyway event though it isnt right now). Now
that I'm writing this, it may not work. but would be very nice to provide symmetry with `;` which
could do the same thing but be trailing.

# 26 July 2023

**Trailing lambda problem**

For awhile now I've been noticing an awkwardness in the language due to the lack of elegant support
for trailing arguments.

Take, for example, a hypothetical if/else or try/catch implementation (assume no macros).

```
if x < 3
    then:
        bloop()
        bleep()
    else:
        blop()

try
    this:
        can_throw()
    catch:
        ball()
```

This can be trivially solved with macros The issue is that this is a common pattern, and the average
user shouldn't have to resort to macros almost ever.

Looking at this now, it's really not all that bad. But I'm wondering if it would be worth it to
complicate the language and add an operator that applies a line as if it were an argument to the
preceding function call:

```
if x < 3 do
    bleep()
-else:
    bloop()

try do
    can_throw()
-catch:
    ball()

// Or

if x < 3 do
    bleep()
\else:
    bloop()

try do
    can_throw()
\catch: do // Should : be implicit?
    ball()

// Or

try do
    can_throw()
,catch: do // Should : be implicit?
    ball()
```

Note: this assumes `do` is a greedy prefix operator. If it wasn't we could also use `do;`. Reminder
that `;` is a greedy terminating operator, so all arguments on the right are applied to do.

**Other**

- Since effects abstract the concept of return, we no longer need to treat blocks as separate from
    functions. `block` can become `do` and `do` can be an alias for `() =>`
- If `:` were a greedy operator, it would implicitly `block` (i.e. `do`)
- Need to experiment.
- I really like how Koka uses a single letter for generics in the type definition for parameters
    that accept a function. Though I'm not a fan of single letter generics in the general sense,
    they're not great at communicating intention. Still worth considering.

TODO: Investigate go like co-routines for use in the language.

Memory semantics.

- Objects are pass by reference
- Everything else is pass by value
- Mutable variables cannot be captured by closures (Inspired by Koka)
- Objects are immutable by default
- There can only ever be one reference to a mutable entity
- Object dereferences are automatic

An object can be marked as mutable with `::mut`:

```
obj Point { x: Int, y: Int, z: Int }
let p = Point::mut { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}
let p2 = p // Error!

fn square(p: Point::mut)
    p.x = p.x.square
    p.y = p.y.square
    p.z = p.z.square

impl Point
    fn square(self::mut)
        self.x = self.x.square
        self.y = self.y.square
        self.z = self.z.square

// Possible alternative for implicit self
impl Point::mut
    fn square()
        x = x.square
        y = y.square
        z = z.square
```

I'd also like to consider requiring parenthesis on any impure function (i.e. cannot look like a
field access)

# 20 July 2023

The previous syntax change had some problems. So I've modified the rules of the language to resolve
some of the ambiguities (among other changes).

- The `=` sign separating a function signature is now optional. It should be used only for single
    line functions.
- Effects are now on the right side of `->`. A function signature is now `fn name() -> (effect
return-type)`. This allows `->` to be treated as an operator and makes the `=` far less complex to
    implement.
- Generics are now defined with `::()`. This prevents us from needing to add hacks to the parser and
    makes the language much more predictable and uniform. Its also inline with the new FQCS
- Introduce FQCS inspired by rust
- Remove `=` from `obj` and `impl` defs.
- Objects now behave more similarly to Rust's structs. Though they are still reference types and can
    be extended, they now only define data. Traits define behavior and can only hold
    functions/methods. Methods must now be define inside of `impl`. For now, extensions must repeat
    all the items they inherit.
- Add Fully Qualified Call Syntax (FQCS) inspired by rust. Makes it possible to impl multiple traits
    with a method that has the same signature

Now all thats left is to:

- Decide casing convention once and for all
    - Native types lowercase? (i32 vs I32)
    - CamelCase?
- Decide on type spacing rules `a:i32` vs `a: i32`

# 9 July 2023

I'm making yet another major change to the syntax. All declaration statements will separate the
signature from the definition using an `=`. This is to improve syntactic consistency across the
language. I.E. Why do some declarations (`type`, `let`, etc) use an `=` while others (fn, obj, etc)
do not. It has the added bonus of making more complex `let` and `type` definitions easier to support
while also making single line functions more readable.

```
// Old syntax
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32
    a + b

// New syntax
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 =
    a + b

// Looks a lot better when we use type inference
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) = a + b
```

I have an obscenely long history of making major syntax changes to this language. While this has
been substantially reduced in the last year, it is still an ongoing problem. This language would
likely be in a much more usable state years ago if I didn't have this habit. But its all for fun in
the end so I guess not much harm is done.

# 8 July 2023

Expanding on the previous entry. There are multiple reasons I've made this change.

- I wanted the type system to be as simple as possible while still having the potential to match the
    power of typescript's type system (with the added bonus of run time types)
- Having both `class` and `struct` and potentially different runtime behavioral characteristics was
    not ideal.
- Structs are stupidly difficult to model in wasm in a way that is both performant and works with a
    gc system.
    - Linear memory cannot hold reference types
    - Structs could leverage multi-value, but they are a pain to work with in binaryen. We'd also have
        to be smart about how we pass them around.

# 4 July 2023

I'm changing the type system again. Heavily inspired by the paper, [Integrating Nominal and
Structural Subtyping](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop08.pdf).

Here are the changes:

- Remove struct and class
- Add object types
    - Objects are nominal
- `type` defines a literal (structural) type (essentially an alias)
- Literal types are structural, object types are nominal
- Most user types are assumed to be heap types now. Will need new /custom syntax do define stack
    types. Do not be afraid to make these more verbose and difficult to use, that is webassembly's
    fault, not yours.

The main benefit to this change is it is much simpler to understand, will likely be more fun write
while also being more maintainable. Thee performance impact is worth the expressiveness. You can
always use the more complex stack type system when you need the performance.

# 5 Dec 2022

**Changes:**

- Greedy operators (`;`, `=`, `=>`, etc) are much smarter now.

When next expression directly follows a greedy op, child expressions of the line are treated as
arguments of that expression. When the next expression is a child expression of the line, they
become part of a block
