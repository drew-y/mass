# High Level

- Make NamedEntity an interface instead of abstract class?
- Add spec for structs (allocated on stack)
- Ensure enums / unions are well defined
	- Maybe support atoms like erlang with `@` syntax (i.e. `@my_atom`)
- Only add lexical scopes to syntax types that need them (block, function, etc).
  Not literally every list and or syntax object.
- Separate meta lexical scopes from runtime lexical scopes
- Support pub use
- Should let and var be a macro? Do we need to transform them into a different
  syntax?
- Improve function overloading support so they can be treated as a normal
	entity. - Idea: Add new entity, FnCollection, which is a collection of
	functions with the same name in the same scope.
- Update generics syntax to `my_fn[T]` instead of `my_fn::<T>` - We should be
	able to do this and keep array syntax as `[1, 2, 3]`. Since we don't support
	array subscript syntax (`my_array[0]`) anyway.
- Support whitespace curly block syntax
- Support macro hygiene
- Overhaul core language spec. It doesn't need to be as different from the
  surface language as it is now. (i.e. does var really need to be `define`)
- Audit code base for side effects, style, and functional purity
- Support whitespace curly block syntax inside of strings / string interpolation
- Repair type system
- Add back support for object syntax
- Add jest tests for code gen phase (assembly phase?)
- Describe / Add [Call By Name
	semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_name) -
	We may want to use swift's @autoclosure feature for this -
	https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/make-by-name-parameters-just-sugar-syntax-rather-than-actual-types/5228/21
- Better separate the language reference from the specification - The
	specification should be a formal description of the language, and use ebnf
	to describe the syntax - The reference should be a more informal description
	of the language, targeting users.
- Support safe mutation https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3471874.3472988
- Cleanup parenthetical elision code, make it more functional if possible

Data types:
- Decide on if self is implicit or explicit
- Should obj be renamed to class
- Decide on wether an obj can have methods as part of their initial definition
- How do we define method requirements in a structural type.
